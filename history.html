                <h1>History:</h1>
                <p>
                    Founded as a Roman city, Barcelona has a rich history that spans over 2,000 years. The city was originally known as "Barcino" and was established in the 1st century BC. 
                    Over the centuries, it has been influenced by various cultures including the Visigoths, Moors, and Franks. Barcelona played a significant role during the Middle Ages as 
                    a major trading hub in the Mediterranean.

                <h1>Gothic Quarter:</h1>
                <p>
                    The city's Gothic Quarter bears witness to the splendour enjoyed by the city from the 13th to the 15th centuries. From the 15th to 18th centuries Barcelona entered a period of decline, 
                    while it struggled to maintain its economic and political independence. This struggle ended in 1714, when the city fell to the Bourbon troops and Catalonia's and Catalans' 
                    rights and privileges were suppressed.

                <p>
                    In the 20th century, Barcelona underwent significant industrialization and urban expansion, leading to the creation of iconic structures such as the Eixample district. The 
                    Catalan Antoni Gaudí, one of the most eminent architects, designed buildings such as the Casa Milà (known as La Pedrera, the Catalan for stone quarry), 
                    the Casa Batlló and the Sagrada Família church, which have become world-famous landmarks.
